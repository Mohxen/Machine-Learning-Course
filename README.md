# Machine-Learning-Course

This repository contains my code implementations and exercises from the Machine Learning Specialization, a 3-course series by DeepLearning.AI and Stanford Online, taught by Andrew Ng. The specialization provides a strong foundation in machine learning, covering supervised, unsupervised learning, and modern AI applications.
